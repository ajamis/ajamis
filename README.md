üëã Hi, I'm Salma Ajami, a passionate Computer Engineering student and software developer in Iran/Golestan.

## About Me
I‚Äôm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering in Golestan, Iran. My passion lies in exploring the world of technology and continuously learning new tools and skills.

I have hands-on experience with Python as my primary programming language and have worked with Django for web development. My journey has also involved building foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside a basic understanding of SQL for database management.

In addition, I‚Äôm familiar with version control systems like Git and GitHub, which I use to manage and collaborate on projects. On the systems side, I‚Äôve spent time working with Linux, particularly Debian, for deploying and managing web applications.

I‚Äôm committed to improving my skills every day, diving deeper into software development, and building meaningful projects that challenge me to grow.
